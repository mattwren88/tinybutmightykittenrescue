      <p>Tiny but Mighty Kitten Rescue's "Feed a Feral" program has been a huge success thanks to our partners at Walmart Logistics and Ren's Pets Cornwall. Their generous donations have helped us distribute thousands of pounds of cat food to help feed the stray and feral cats in our community!</p>
      <p>We aim to help colony caretakers who are actively managing their colony with the goal of spaying or neutering, whenever resources allow, so that we're all working together to ease the cat crisis.</p>
